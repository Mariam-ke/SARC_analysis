## When Numbers Carry Stories
### Exploring Seven Years of Sexual Assault Reporting Data 2013–2020

#### Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of aggregated sexual assault reporting data from the Mirabel Sexual Assault Reporting Centre, covering the period 2013–2020.
The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in reporting, survivor demographics, assault types, and service provision, with the goal of understanding how survivors engage with support systems over time.

All work is conducted with an explicit survivor-respectful and ethical approach.
What This Project Explores

#### The analysis examines:
Trends in reported cases over time
Case distribution by age group and gender
Patterns across different assault types
Relationships between total recorded cases and new clients
Types of victim support services provided (medical, counselling, legal, forensic)
The findings highlight both system strengths in care delivery and structural gaps between reporting, service provision, and legal outcomes.

#### Data Ethics & Handling
Data is fully anonymized and aggregated
No personal identifiers or case narratives are included
No sensationalism or victim-level analysis
Analysis is intended for insight, awareness, and system-level learning
This project treats the data as a reflection of human experiences, not just numerical trends.

#### Key Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
Outputs
Time-series visualizations of reported cases
Comparative plots by age group and gender
Trend analysis of assault categories
Service provision trends over time
A narrative version of this analysis is published as a Medium article.

#### Notes
A decline in reported cases and services in 2020 likely reflects access disruptions, not reduced need.
Findings should be interpreted as contextual indicators, not definitive causal conclusions.
